## What can I do with it?

The SpatialOS GDK for Unity (GDK) enables you to create online games that were previously impossible without specialized staff and skill sets.

It features fast development iteration, Unity-native workflows, high performance and customizability. We develop in the open, with our developer community shaping what we do.

The GDK is available **right now**, with FPS starter project provided as a quick way to get off the ground. We recommend getting started by launching a cloud deployment of the project so you can see it running at scale and get a taste for the workflow and tooling.

[Deploy a game to the cloud right now!]({{urlRoot}}/projects/template-fps/setup-and-installing)

Follow those instructions and you can be running at scale in no time.

## Getting started with the FPS Starter Project

The FPS starter project is a great starting point for your own projects.

Once you've seen run a SpatialOS game at scale in the cloud, dive into the GDK and learn how it works.

Once you’re set up you can start to get to grips with SpatialOS by downloading, deploying, and playing out our open source First Person Shooter (FPS) Template Project!


We then have a [tutorial](fix) you can follow to add Health Pick-ups functionality to this project, and learn about the development experience on the GDK in the process. You can also follow our [Scaling Tutorial](fix), which adds up to **N00** fake players which will connect into your cloud deployment.

## A powerful platform with great tooling

The SpatialOS platform provides the power of cloud scaling, backed up by great tooling for managing on online games.

Along tools for logging and metrics, to help you track down issues and monitor the health of your deployments, you can also survey your entire virtual world with the help of the SpatialOS Inspector.

This fantastic tool allows you the macro perspective of how your servers are running, right along side the ability to zoom in and examine the game state of your players and other entities as they move around.
