# Welcome to the SpatialOS GDK for Unity!


You can get started with SpatialOS for Unity by installing SpatialOS and the GDK for Unity by following our set up guide:

[GET STARTED NOW]({{urlRoot}}/setup-and-installing)

Once you’re set up you can start to get to grips with SpatialOS by downloading, deploying, and playing out our open source First Person Shooter (FPS) Template Project!

We then have a [tutorial](fix) you can follow to add Health Pick-ups functionality to this project, and learn about the development experience on the GDK in the process. You can also follow our [Scaling Tutorial](fix), which adds up to **N00** fake players which will connect into your cloud deployment.
