# SpatialOS GDK for Unity (alpha)

Welcome to the SpatialOS GDK community.

The SpatialOS Game Development Kit (GDK) for Unity enables game developers to build multiplayer Unity games with SpatialOS. It will be made up of three parts:

* the GDK Core, a performant, data-driven SpatialOS multiplayer integration.

* a library of solutions for hard or common networked game development problems via Feature Modules.

* the example game, which both tests and demonstrates the Feature Modules; for use as a starting point or resource for game development.

For further high-level information about this, see the summary of [key features]({{urlRoot}}/content/faqs/key-features).

This is an alpha release of the GDK Core which is the foundation of the product. To find out more see the GDK blogpost.
