The FPS starter project is a great starting point for working on the SpatialOS GDK for Unity. Many projects, whatever their genre, share some core elements and this starter project can get you off to a easy start.

The SpatialOS GDK can help you run your games at scale, making it easy for even a small team to make a massive multiplayer hit game. The FPS starter project is already configured to scale-up, and you can test it out right now! Check out the [FPS at scale]({{urlRoot}}/projects/template-fps/welcome) guide to dive right in!

<%(#Expandable title="How is the FPS Starter Project licensed?")%>We _**want**_ you to build on top of the FPS starter project.

You can find out information about licensing for the SpatialOS GDK for Unity, and its accompanying projects, on the [licensing]({{urlRoot}}/license) page.<%(/Expandable)%>

### Where to start?

Get started with the FPS starter project right now!

We thoroughly recommend getting the FPS starter project set up on your computer and deploying it to the cloud so you can see how simple it is to launch a massive large-scale multiplayer game.

### Get learning!

The SpatialOS GDK for Unity lets you bring your own tools. Integrating seamlessly with Unity Engine, you can enhance your existing workflow with some great tooling for building games at scale, no matter your team size.

To get you started, the FPS starter project is accompanied by a tutorial for implementing a familiar game mechanic: health pack pickups!

This tutorial will introduce you to the GDK workflow, give you a sense of what you need to do differently, and get you oriented and ready for building your own features on top of the FPS starter project, or on your own game.

Check out the [health pickups tutorial]({{urlRoot}}/projects/template-fps/tutorial) to get started!

### What's in the box?

Get yourself oriented with what's inside the FPS starter project.

With any existing project it can be hard to find your way around. To help you get your bearings, so you can start building your own features on top of the project, you can read up on the [anatomy of the FPS](fix).

It will walk you through some of the projects current mechanics, how the SpatialOS GDK was used, explain some of the design choices and give you tips for how to make great choices when working on your own project.

### Licensing

We will continue to make the FPS Starter Project a streamlined example of best practice that we _**want**_ you to build on top of. The FPS starter project is shared under the Improbable license, and you can read more about what that entails in our [licensing]({{urlRoot}}/license) section.
